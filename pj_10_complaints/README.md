# pj_10_complaints – Airline Complaint Analysis & Route Optimization

## Overview
This project analyzes airline complaint data in the context of the Isle Paradiso tourism board’s efforts to expand air routes and improve visitor experience. The project explores trends, issues, and opportunities in the airline industry that can inform strategic decision-making for a tourism-reliant island nation.

## Objective
To use complaint data and regional metrics to:
- Identify key pain points in the air travel experience.
- Explore potential new flight routes to Isle Paradiso.
- Present visual insights that support route optimization and tourism strategy.

## Dataset Sources
- `complaints-by-airport.csv`: Aggregated complaint volume by airport.
- `complaints-by-category.csv`: Complaint types like delays, service, baggage, etc.
- `complaints-by-subcategory.csv`: Detailed subcategories of issues reported.
- `iata-icao.csv`: Mapping of airport codes used for geographic plotting and alignment.

## Methods
- **Data Cleaning**: Merged and filtered relevant fields (e.g., complaint volume by category and airport).
- **Visualizations**: Created in Python using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to highlight key issues and trends.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Basic aggregations, trends, and correlation heatmaps.

## Key Visuals
- Line Charts: Complaint volume trends over time.
- Bar Charts: Top complaint categories and affected airports.
- Heatmaps: Regional issue density and complaint clustering.
- Geographic Maps: Distribution of airports involved in complaint cases.

## Tools & Languages
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub
- Data formatted in `.csv` and `.xlsx`

## Ethical Considerations
- **Synthetic Data**: Some datasets were simulated for demonstration.
- **Privacy**: No personal identifiable information (PII) is used.
- **Bias**: Visuals and interpretations aim to be fair and avoid misleading narratives.
- **Sustainability**: Recommendations also consider environmental and local cultural impact.

## Deliverables
- Summary report: `650w9&10_ex_Gwanvoma.docx`
- Final visualizations and Python code.
- README documentation (this file).
