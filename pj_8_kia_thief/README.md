## 📁 Files and Artifacts

- `Kia theft Analysis_DSC640_Gwanvoma.docx` – Project summary and narrative report
- `kia_theft-assignment_Gwanvoma.pdf` – Final output with data cleaning, transformations, visualizations, and analysis
- `kia_theft assignment_Gwanvoma.Rmd` – R Markdown source file (code and documentation)
- `KiaHyundaiMilwaukeeData.csv` – Theft trends in Milwaukee
- `kiaHyundaiThefts.csv` – Broader city-level theft data for Kia/Hyundai vs. other vehicles

- `carTheftsMap.csv` – Agency-level data for visual mapping

## 🔍 Objective

To:
- Identify patterns and hotspots in Kia/Hyundai vehicle thefts
- Compare trends with other vehicle thefts
- Recommend targeted actions based on insights

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Sources**: Aggregated from public crime reports, VICE News data, and city-specific theft logs
- **Tools Used**: R (ggplot2, dplyr, readxl, treemap, ggforce), Excel
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed missing and irrelevant columns
  - Aggregated thefts by month and city
  - Anonymized location-based data to preserve privacy

## 📊 Visualizations Included

1. **Pie Chart** – Proportion of Kia/Hyundai thefts vs. other vehicles
2. **Donut Chart** – Theft distribution over time (monthly trends)
3. **Stacked Bar Chart** – Theft counts by city
4. **Treemap** – Theft distribution in Milwaukee
5. **Area Chart** – Monthly trend of Kia/Hyundai thefts
6. **Multi-layer Pie Chart** – Theft proportions by city and vehicle type

## 🧩 Key Insights

- **Spike in thefts** observed in Milwaukee over several months
- **Kia/Hyundai thefts** represent a significant proportion compared to other brands
- Specific cities and months show unusually high activity

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

- All data was anonymized and aggregated at a non-personal level
- Visuals were designed to avoid bias and misinterpretation
- Explicit assumptions and limitations were documented in the report

## 📢 Recommendations

- Invest in **public education** and **anti-theft technology**
- Focus resources on **high-theft neighborhoods**
- Enhance **collaborations with manufacturers** to improve vehicle security

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- The power of visualization to highlight systemic patterns
- Importance of ethical and unbiased data handling in public safety projects
- Clear communication through narrative and design principles (e.g., Gestalt)
