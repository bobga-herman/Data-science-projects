## 📌 Project Title
**Analyzing U.S. Childcare Costs Using National County-Level Data**

## 📁 Folder
`pj_5_childcare`

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes the National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) to uncover trends and disparities in childcare costs across the U.S. from a demographic and economic perspective. The dataset includes over 200 columns spanning geographic, demographic, and economic variables, enabling an in-depth exploratory data analysis.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Childcare costs vary significantly by **state, county, and age group**, with **infant care** being the most expensive.
- **Urban areas** have consistently higher childcare costs than rural ones.
- **Inflationary trends** were observed, showing rising childcare prices year over year.
- **Higher unemployment rates** often correlate with **lower childcare costs**, potentially due to subsidized care or reduced demand.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how geographic and demographic factors influence childcare affordability.
- Visualize trends and disparities using interactive dashboards and infographics.
- Recommend policy actions to improve equitable access to affordable childcare.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) using Python/R
- **Visualizations**: Tableau, Power BI, and presentation charts
- **PDF Report & Slide Deck** for technical and non-technical audiences

## 📉 Visuals Included
- Pie chart of childcare cost distribution by state
- Donut chart of cost breakdown by age group (Infant, Toddler, Preschool)
- Stacked bar chart of top 5 states’ costs by age group
- Area charts showing cost trends over time, including inflation-adjusted versions
- County-level tree maps highlighting regional variations

## 👥 Target Audience
- Policymakers
- Economic researchers
- Journalists investigating childcare accessibility
- Workforce development advocates

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- **No PII**: Dataset contains no personally identifiable information
- **Transparency**: Documented data transformations and exclusions
- **Bias mitigation**: Treated missing values as gaps, not zeroes
- **Regulatory compliance**: Followed data privacy and presentation standards

## 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Early collaboration with domain experts is vital to understanding unclear flag fields and calculation methods.
- Clear metadata improves analytical rigor.
- Interactive dashboards engage users more effectively than static charts.
