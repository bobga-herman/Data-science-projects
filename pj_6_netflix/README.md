This project analyzes publicly available Netflix viewing data to identify global and regional content consumption patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights for Netflix strategists, marketers, and media analysts by examining top-performing shows, category-wise engagement, and regional preferences over time.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand global vs. regional preferences for Netflix content

- Analyze temporal patterns in viewership using weekly trends

## 🧩 Data Sources
- `all-weeks-countries-netflix.xlsx`: Country-level weekly rankings
- `all-weeks-global-netflix.xlsx`: Global-level weekly rankings
- `most-popular-netflix.xlsx`: All-time top Netflix content by hours viewed

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Charts** showing top-viewed shows globally and by region
- **Trend Lines** for weekly ranking changes
- **Comparative Regional Charts** to highlight differing preferences
- **Category-Level Analysis** by total viewing hours
